# [Singaporean Crosswalk - Joo Won Park](https://joowonpark.net/crosswalkupdates/)

> Singaporean Crosswalk was inspired by my trip to Singapore in 2010. The sound of the traffic light in the city was quite different from that of the United States and Korea.

## Notes from rehearsals
- Try with mobile version (possibly re-record as group if time allows)
- "Be in character and make deliberate choices"
- Follow the pre-determined paths e.g. so it looks like you're actually following crosswalks
- Look around, look both ways as if crossing the street
