# Umute - [Flannery Cunningham](http://flannerycunningham.com/)

>I have always found singing in choirs a deeply poignant, community-building experience. 
For me, there’s something uniquely joyful about joining one’s voice with others in a 
collective sound created by instruments housed in their users’ bodies. But of course not 
everyone has a voice that can sing. Unmute, then began as a challenge to myself: could I 
write a “voiceless” choral piece that would replicate at least something of the shared 
bodily experience of singing together? Using facial mapping and tracking, the electronics 
for Unmute determine the vowel that a player performs and use that in combination with a 
selected scale degree to control triggering of sound files. Hand motions performed above 
a Leap motion sensor provide control of dynamics and timbre. I imagine Unmute as providing 
an augmentation for a sung choral experience and as (hopefully) bringing that experience 
to a broadened array of sound-makers. Let’s sing (or “sing”) together.
