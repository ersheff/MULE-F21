# inChuck - Stephen David Beck

Welcome to inChuck. You perform inChuck by adding melodic "processes"
to the system, indicating which process, how many times it should be played,
and in what register.  To add a process to the piece, type:
   
chuck + x:y:z
   
where:
 x is the process number (1 - 19),
 y is the number of repetions (8 is default), and
 z is the octave (2 - 7, 4 is middle register and default).
   
Example: chuck + 3:10:5 plays process #3 ten times an octave above middle C
   
Play the processes in sequence. Start at process 1. You are encouraged to 
repeat a process, but you should not go backwards. Focus on one process for
between 30-60 seconds.
   
Take your time and listen to what others are doing. Make sure you sustain the
ensemble's sound density. Most importantly, have fun.
When you have reached process #19 and are done, type "chuck --kill".
   
If you are the pulse, start now by typing:
   
chuck + pulse*
